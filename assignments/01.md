# Layers

Create directories for each layer in the `src/` directory:

- Domain
- Application
- Infrastructure

Now move all the code and resources in `src/` to the appropriate "layer".

Afterwards, verify that the *dependency rule* applies.

## Hints

- Use `bin/deptrac.sh` to verify the *dependency rule*.
- Bonus: consider wrapping `app/container.php` inside some class. Where would it belong in the new directory structure?
